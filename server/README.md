- Created a superuser
- Python3 manage.py runserver
- Create an app [python3 manage.py startapp user ./apps/user], and then register it on INSTALLED_APPS. Update then the name in apps.py
- When modules are not found is usually that the venv/ python interpreter is not selected properly. 
- Every time I modify the models: run a makemigrations and migrate
- Django Rest Framework (DRF) provides features like serialization, deserialization, request parsing, response rendering, auth and authorization.
